# Working Roadmap

> Singleton structure — maintain this file at `docs/project/working-roadmap.md`; update sections instead of creating copies.

> Limit this file to the 2–3 initiatives currently in flight. Each item should have explicit acceptance criteria and align to a milestone in `project/roadmap.md`.
