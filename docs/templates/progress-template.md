# Progress Log Entry Template

> Singleton structure — append these entries to the shared `docs/project/progress.md` file rather than creating new files.

```
## YYYY-MM-DD (Title / Focus Area)

- Summary of work accomplished (link to specs/implementation/features touched).
- Tests executed (commands + results).
- Documentation updates (list files edited, include roadmap/progress/feature docs).
- Next steps / follow-up tasks.
- Blockers or questions (link to TBD tracker entries if applicable).
```

> Append entries chronologically to `docs/project/progress.md`. Keep each entry succinct but explicit about what changed.
