# Incoming Entry Template

Use this snippet when you drop something into `docs/incoming.md`. Keep it messy, fast, and separated by `---`.

```
---
TODO: <short title or action>
Notes: <any quick context, links, or reminders>
```

Delete entries from `docs/incoming.md` once you promote them into the proper doc.
